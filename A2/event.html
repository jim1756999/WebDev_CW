        <h1 class="heading_banner">Caber Toss</h1>
        <p>Tossing is a unique traditional event in Scotland. It is said that it originated from the logging workers
            throwing logs before they crossed the chasm on the ground. Contestants must wear short skirts and throw a
            huge wooden pole called a caber. The standard rod is 19 feet 6 inches (about 5.94 meters) long and weighs
            175 pounds (about 79 kilograms). The wood pole is divided into top and bottom ends. The contestant grabs the
            tail end and throws the wood pole so that the top end will touch the ground. The final result of the game
            depends not only on who throws far, but also on the verticality of the wood after it hits the ground. The
            wood pole with the first end on the ground will be regarded as the hour hand on the clock. The vertical is
            12:00 and the score with an inclination of 11:00 is higher than the score with an inclination of 10:30, but
            the same as the score of 1:00. And so on. The score for the end of the wooden pole to land and fall to the
            contestant is the lowest.</p>

        <h1 class="heading">Hammer Throw</h1>
        <p>The recreational activities of blacksmiths and miners from Scotland in the Middle Ages in their spare time.
            They use hammers with wooden handles as heavy objects, and the game depends on who throws the farthest. In
            the Scottish Highlands, people still use the kind of long-handled hammers hundreds of years ago for retro
            games. In the late 19th century, the hammer became an event at the Oxford and Cambridge University Games,
            and the hammer also changed from a hammer to a round ball. Since then, for the convenience of throwing, the
            ball handle has also been changed from a wooden one to a steel chain. In the 2nd Paris Olympic Games in
            1900, men's hammer throw was listed as a competition event, but it was not until the 27th Sydney Olympic
            Games in 2000 that women's hammer throw was listed as an official event.</p>

        <h1 class="heading">Bagpipes</h1>
        <p>In addition to the bands of the Pipe Band Competition from Scotland, there are also bands from North America
            and Australia. Usually there is a band of 16 to 20 people, with pipers, one playing bass drum, and several
            playing snare drums.
        </p>
        <p>Highland dance is characterized by frequent kicks and turns, with the upper body without much movement except
            for raising hands. One of the characteristics is to show and thank you before and after the dance, that is,
            hands on hips, bow forward ninety degrees, but always face the audience.</p>
