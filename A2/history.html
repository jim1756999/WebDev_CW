        <p>The Modern Highland Games was to a large extent a Victorian invention, developed after the clearance of the
            highlands.

            Although the evidence is scarce, attempts have been made to discover early gaming traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fetteresso may be an example of an early game venue, although technically it is located a few miles south of
            the Scottish Highlands.

            It is more likely that these games originated from deer hunting activities carried out by residents of the
            highlands before Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first mention of the type of event held at the Scottish Highland Games was during King Malcolm III
            (Scottish Gaelic: Máel Coluim; c. 1031 – November 13, 1093), when he called The man rushed to Craig
            Choinnich, overlooking Braemar, with the goal of finding the fastest runner in Scotland as his royal
            messenger. It is also believed that Scotland's strongest and bravest soldier will be tested. Encourage
            musicians and dancers to demonstrate their skills and talents, thereby earning great honors for the clan
            they represent.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a document dated 1703 that summoned Lord Grant's clan Grant Clan. They will arrive wearing highland
            coats, "with guns, swords, pistols, and daggers". From this letter, it can be speculated that the game will
            include weapon feats.
