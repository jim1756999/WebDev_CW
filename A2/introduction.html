        <p>The Scottish Highland Sports is an event held in Scotland that best reflects the spirit of Scotland. This
            event has a long history. This type of traditional highland sports exudes unique charm because of the
            combination of dancing, drinking, and food that allows players to be fully brave and magical.</p>
        <p>It is said that the Highland Games originated in Ireland in 2000 BC. As the Scots in the fourth and fifth
            centuries migrated to Argyll and beyond, they crossed the water to reach Scotland. Here are some key trivia
            about the Highland Games. They are a highlight of the Scottish summer calendar and one of the country’s
            oldest and most precious traditions.</p>

        <h2>Highland Games Around the World</h2>
        <p>There are many Highland Games in Australia and New Zealand. More and more communities in Europe are also
            rediscovering their Celtic traditions by holding their own highland games, and there are about 46 games in
            Germany alone.</p>
        <h2>Scotland's Most Iconic Highland Games</h2>
        <p>The Braemar Gathering, held in September, is the biggest and most prestigious Highland Games event and enjoys
            the annual attendance of the Royal Family. Its origins are Royal too. The contests of strength – jumping,
            running, throwing and riding – were introduced by Malcolm Canmore in 1040 as a means of selecting the most
            able men for soldiers and couriers.

            Highland games events take place almost everywhere in Scotland each year. From major towns and cities to
            tiny villages and far-flung islands, wherever you are in Scotland, you can be sure there is somewhere nearby
            which hosts its own games.</p>
